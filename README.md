# OOP Project
This is my OOP Project on Hospital Management System in Java. 
I developed a user-friendly GUI with intuitive navigation across modules like Info, Enroll, Billing and Pharmacy
It handles real-time operations including patient registrations, appointments, room checks, and test records with clean OOP design
